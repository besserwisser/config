# Neovim Cheatsheet

A personal collection of useful commands and concepts.

## Basic Navigation

- Put your right index finger on `j` and the middle finger on `k` for easy navigation.
- `<C-f>` and `<C-b>` - **Page down** and **page up**.
- `<C-e>` and `<C-y>` - **Scroll down** and **scroll up** one line without moving the cursor.
- `H`, `M`, `L` - Move the cursor to the **top**, **middle**, or **bottom** of the screen.
- `zz` - **Center** the current line in the window. Also works with `zt` (top) and `zb` (bottom).
- `-` and `+` - Move to the **previous** or **next** line and go to first non-whitespace character of the line (like pressing `k` / `j` and `^`.

## Word and Character Movement

- `e` / `E` - Jump to the **end** of the current word. `E` uses WORDs (delimited by whitespace).
- `w` / `W` - Jump forward to the start of the next **word**. `W` uses WORDs. Often time you can use it to jump between function names or variables or other identifiers.
- `f{char}` / `F{char}` - **Find** a character on the current line (forward/backward).
- `t{char}` / `T{char}` - Jump **'til** (just before) a character on the current line (forward/backward).
- `;` / `,` - **Repeat** the last `f`, `F`, `t`, or `T` motion forward (`;`) or backward (`,`).

## Advanced Navigation

- `'m` and `m - Jump to beginning of mark line or exact position of mark.
- `g;` and `g,` - Jump to the next or previous change in the file.
- `gx` - Open the URL under the cursor in your default web browser.
- `[{` - Jump to the **previous unmatched `{` brace**. Can be combined with `v%` (e.g., `[{v%`) to select the entire block.
- `'.` - Jump to the **exact position** of the last change.
- `f(w` - Jump to function arguments (inside parentheses).
- `]m` / `[m` - Jump to the start of the **next/previous method** in languages like C, Java, or Python.
- `]M` / `[M` - Jump to the end of the **next/previous method**.
- `[{` / `]}` - Jump to the previous/next `{` brace from inside a code block.
- `[(` / `])` - Jump to the previous/next `(` from inside a code block.
- `]]` / `[[` - Jump to next/previous `{` in the first column.

- `D` - delete from the cursor to the end of the line (same as `d$`).
- `<C-[>` or `<C-c>` - Exit insert mode (similiar as `Esc`).
- `J` - **Join** the current line with the next line, adding a space between them. Also works with a count (e.g., `3J` joins three lines). Also works in visual mode. Can also be used to make multi line arrays and objects in one line.

## Text Objects and Advanced Editing

- `cib` - **Change inside block** (parentheses). Deletes content inside `()` and enters insert mode.
- `cgn` - **Change** the **next search match**. Can be repeated with `.`.

- `an` / `in` - Select **around** or **inside** a node in languages like XML or HTML.
- `^vg_` - Select from the first non-blank character to the last non-blank character of the line.

## Insert Mode Commands

- `<C-r>{register}` - **Paste** the content from a specified register. For example, `<C-r>"` pastes from the default register.
- `<C-x><C-s>` - **Signature Help**. When an LSP is active, this can show function parameter information. Note: `<C-s>` alone often freezes the terminal (XOFF).
- `<C-s>` - Shows function signature help when an LSP is active.
- `<C-o>{cmd}` - Execute a single normal mode command while in insert mode. For example, `<C-o>dw` deletes a word without leaving insert mode.

- `<C-h>` - **Delete** the character before the cursor (like Backspace).
- `<C-w>` - **Delete** the word before the cursor.
- `<C-u>` - **Delete** from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
- `S` or `cc` - **Change (replace) the entire line** and enter insert mode. It starts at proper indentation instead of the beginning of the line.

## Search

- `<C-p>` / `<C-n>` - Navigate through **command-line history** (previous/next).

- `/\c` - Start a search that is **case-insensitive** or `/\C` for **case-sensitive**.
- `\V` - Very nomagic mode. All characters are treated as literal characters except `\`.

## Substitution

- `:/start/,/end/s/old/new/g` - Perform a **substitution** between lines matching "start" and "end".
